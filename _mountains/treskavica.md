Treskavica is one of Bosnia and Herzegovina's most remote and pristine mountains, offering solitude and untouched wilderness for those willing to venture off the beaten path.

## Overview

Rising southeast of Sarajevo, Treskavica is characterized by gentle slopes, vast plateaus, and numerous glacial lakes. The mountain's name derives from the Serbian word "treska" (cod), referring to the mountain's elongated shape.
