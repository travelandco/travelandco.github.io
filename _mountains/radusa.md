Raduša is a relatively gentle mountain in central Bosnia, known for its rolling grassy slopes, shepherd traditions, and the historic Zahum peak that dominates the landscape.

## Overview

Part of the Vranica-Raduša mountain group, Raduša features softer contours compared to the dramatic limestone peaks elsewhere in the Dinarics. The mountain is historically significant and culturally rich, with active shepherd traditions continuing to this day.

## Key Features
