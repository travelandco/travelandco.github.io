Our two-day expedition through Durmitor National Park proved to be one of our most memorable adventures. Staying in the charming town of Žabljak, we explored Montenegro's crown jewel, summited Bobotov Kuk, and experienced the mesmerizing beauty of Black Lake.

## Day 1: Journey to the Summit

We set out before dawn from Žabljak, our base for this expedition. The beautiful weekend house we stayed in provided the perfect mountain retreat—warm, comfortable, and with stunning views of the surrounding peaks each morning.

### The Ascent to Bobotov Kuk

The trail to Montenegro's highest peak, Bobotov Kuk (2523m), started relatively gently through alpine meadows still glistening with morning dew. As we gained elevation, the landscape transformed dramatically. Limestone cliffs rose around us, and the trail became increasingly technical.

The final approach to the summit required careful scrambling over loose rocks and exposed sections. Each step needed concentration, but the growing views kept our spirits high. Fellow hikers we met along the way shared our excitement and determination.

### Summit Experience

Reaching the summit cairn was an incredible moment. At 2523 meters, standing on Montenegro's highest point, we could see:

- The entire Durmitor massif spreading in all directions
- The deep cut of Tara Canyon to the north
- Distant peaks in Albania and Bosnia
- Even a glimpse of the Adriatic Sea on the western horizon

We spent almost an hour on top, taking photos, enjoying snacks, and simply absorbing the magnificent 360-degree panorama. The weather was perfect—clear skies with just a gentle breeze.

## Day 2: Black Lake and Reflection

### Morning at Crno Jezero

The second day brought a different kind of beauty. We visited Crno Jezero (Black Lake), Durmitor's most famous glacial lake, just a short walk from Žabljak.

The easy trail around the lake allowed us to fully appreciate its beauty. The water, incredibly clear, perfectly reflected the surrounding peaks. In some spots, the lake lived up to its name with deep, dark waters; in others, it shone brilliant turquoise.

### Wildlife and Nature

Throughout our two days, we encountered:
- Chamois grazing on distant slopes
- Eagles soaring on thermal currents
- Countless wildflowers coloring the alpine meadows
- Ancient twisted pines clinging to limestone cliffs

### The Weekend House

Our accommodation in Žabljak deserves special mention. The weekend house offered everything we needed—comfortable beds after long hikes, a fully equipped kitchen where we prepared hearty meals, and a terrace where we spent evenings reviewing photos and planning the next day's adventures.

## Reflections

Durmitor exceeded all expectations. The combination of challenging hiking, stunning natural beauty, and comfortable accommodation made this expedition perfect. Bobotov Kuk tested our limits while Black Lake reminded us that mountains offer peace as well as challenge.

### Recommendations

**For the Summit:**
- Start very early (we left at 5:30 AM)
- Bring warm layers—it's cold and windy at the top
- Allow 8-10 hours for the round trip
- Good boots essential for rocky terrain
- Trekking poles highly recommended

**For Black Lake:**
- Perfect for rest day or afternoon visit
- Allow 2-3 hours for complete circuit
- Great for photography in morning light
- Swimming possible in summer (brave souls!)

**Accommodation in Žabljak:**
- Weekend houses offer authentic experience
- Book ahead in summer season
- Many have mountain views
- Perfect base for exploring the park

## Final Thoughts

Two days in Durmitor barely scratched the surface of what this incredible national park offers. We're already planning our return—perhaps for a longer traverse or to explore the ice caves. For now, we carry memories of **stunning heights** at Montenegro's roof and the peaceful reflection of mountains in Black Lake's mirror surface.

The drive back to Bosnia felt bittersweet. Durmitor had captured our hearts, and we knew we'd be back soon. Until then, the photos and memories would have to sustain us—until the mountains call again.
