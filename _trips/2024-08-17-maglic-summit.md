Our attempt to conquer Maglić, the Roof of BiH, turned into an unexpected but charming retreat to the stunning **Trnovačko Lake**. The mountain had other plans for us, delivering a persistent downpour that halted our ascent. Despite not reaching the summit, the experience was memorable.

## The Route and the Rain

We started our journey towards the peak, but unfortunately, the rain started shortly after. Our main goal shifted to reaching the famous heart-shaped lake, **Trnovačko Jezero**.

The trail to the lake led us through beautiful forest paths, wet and muddy from the relentless rain. Upon arrival, the lake's iconic turquoise waters were shrouded in mist, creating a dramatic, mysterious atmosphere.

## Lakeside Retreat

The persistent rain made any further ascent too risky, so we took shelter under a makeshift awning near the lake. While waiting for the downpour to cease, we enjoyed a uniquely alpine experience: savoring the incredible aroma of **grah** (bean stew) being cooked and shared by other resourceful hikers nearby. The simple joy of being sheltered, surrounded by breathtaking nature, and inhaling the comforting scent of a warm meal was the true highlight of the day.

## Descent and Reflections

After a few hours, recognizing that the summit was out of reach due to the continuous bad weather, we began our descent. Though we didn't summit Maglić, we connected with the mountain's wild side and found pleasure in the unplanned pause. Our legs were less tired, but our spirits were high, already planning a drier return to explore the higher reaches of Sutjeska National Park.

### Recommendations

- Always **check the weather forecast** and be prepared for rapid changes, especially rain.
- The path to Trnovačko Lake is a beautiful hike even if the summit is inaccessible.
- **Pack extra layers and rain gear**—you never know when you'll need to shelter.
- Allow plenty of time to enjoy the atmosphere at the lake.
