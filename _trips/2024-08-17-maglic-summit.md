Our unforgettable ascent to the highest peak of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Through ancient forests and rocky terrain to 2,386 meters above sea level, Maglić offered us breathtaking views and an experience we'll cherish forever.

## The Route

We started early morning from the Prijevor mountain hut, following the well-marked trail through the pristine Perućica primeval forest. The initial section took us through dense beech and spruce trees, with the morning mist creating an almost magical atmosphere.

As we gained elevation, the forest gradually gave way to alpine meadows and rocky terrain. The trail became steeper, requiring careful footing on loose rocks and occasional scrambling over boulders.

## Summit Experience

Reaching the summit cairn after 4 hours of steady climbing was incredibly rewarding. The 360-degree panorama revealed the stunning Sutjeska National Park below, with Trnovačko Lake glistening like a jewel in the valley. To the east, we could see into Montenegro's Durmitor range.

The weather was perfect - clear skies and mild temperatures, allowing us to spend almost an hour at the top, taking photos and enjoying well-deserved snacks.

## Descent and Reflections

The descent followed the same route, taking about 3.5 hours with stops. Our legs were tired but spirits high, already planning our return to explore more of Sutjeska's incredible landscape.

### Recommendations

- Start early to avoid afternoon thunderstorms
- Bring plenty of water (no sources above treeline)
- Trekking poles highly recommended for descent
- Check weather forecast - conditions can change rapidly

- Allow full day for the round trip
